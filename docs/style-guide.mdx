# Style Guide

When writing snapblocks that is meant to be viewed by others, it's important to write snapblocks as clean and as readable as possible. This guide will help you to write clean snapblocks code that anyone can read.

## Overrides

Always put a space before and after `::`.

```snapblocks
block :: motion // good
block::motion // bad
```

The only reason why no space before `::` was used on the wiki before,
was because of a bug that has since been fixed.

Whenever writing code, try not to set the category or shape, unless the
block doesn't exist in Scratch or Snap<i>!</i> (Snap<i>!</i> libraries are not
included).

```snapblocks
move (10) steps :: motion command // bad
move (10) steps // good

vee :: looks // good
```

## Comments

Put spaces before and after `//` when writing comments.

```snapblocks
// good
//bad
block // good
block//bad
```

## Inputs

Put spaces around inputs.

```snapblocks
move (10) steps // good
move(10)steps // bad
```

## Indentation

### C-Blocks

Indent scripts inside a c-shape.

```snapblocks
// good
if <> {
  say [Hello!]
  if <> {
    move (10) steps
  }
}

// bad
if <> {
say [Hello!]
if <> {
move (10) steps
}
}
```

Indents can be 2 or 4 spaces, but should stay consistent.

### Multiline Blocks

Indent multiline reporter and predicate blocks to the
opening bracket.

```snapblocks
multiline \
block

(multiline
 block)

<multiline
 block>
    
move (x position
      with extra stuff) steps
```

### Multiline Inputs

Don't indent multiline string inputs, as the spaces will be placed inside
the input.

```snapblocks
// good
say [Hello
world]

// bad
say [Hello
     world]
```

This is due to a limitation, it would be indented if spaces weren't
included.

## Shapes

Don't use shape overrides, unless necessary.

```snapblocks
(block) // good
block :: reporter // bad
```

## Define Block

When creating a Snap<i>!</i> define block, use `define+` instead of manually
placing in plusses, so you don't accidentally miss a plus sign.

```snapblocks
{custom block} :: define+
```
